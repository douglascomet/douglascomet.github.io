I am a technical artist and graduate of the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy's Masters program. I focus on visual effects, rigging, and scripting tools in Python. I'm passionate about perfecting every aspect of the production pipeline in order to make the imagined believable. My favorite aspect of the tech art field being able to facilitate the bridge between the artists and programmers.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies and playing video games. If I have access to a metal/wood shop I enjoy building props inspired from the most influential stories to me. My background from building comes from working with my dad to make household repairs and being a member of battle robots team in high school. My battle robots team were always underdogs and rarely won but I gained a lot of experience of using power tools like lathes, welding stations, band saws, grinders, and sanders.
